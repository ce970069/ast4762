    "With this lab are two sets of images of two asteroids. Each set has three images of the asteroid. In this lab you will play the astronomical version of \"Where's Waldo\" and find the asteroid in **one set of images**. Load the first image into DS9. The default scaling that the image is loaded with isn't very nice, and doesn't highlight the image features. Try improving the greyscale by selecting **Scale > Zscale** in DS9. Then select **Edit > Colorbar** and try dragging your mouse around the image while holding the left  mouse button down (you should see the greyscale of the image change as you do this). If you still don't see image features, don't give up! Ask an instructor for help.\n",

If your image didnt have a WCS, you could try applying one by uploading your fits files to [http://nova.astrometry.net/upload](http://nova.astrometry.net/upload). For the algorithm to work, your image must have a fair number of stars in it---so no promises. If astrometry.net finds a solution, click on **Go to results page**. At the next image, download \"new-image.fits\". This should be a version of your image with a WCS applied (although, again, no promises).

The easiest way to estimate the asteroid position is by centering a DS9 circle on the asteroid (this may not be the most precise way, but it is good enough for today). Be careful to really try and get the circle centered! It might help to zoom in on the asteroid (you can do this by going to **Zoom > Zoom In**) and/or by shrinking the size of the circle (you can do this by single clicking on the circle so that four points appear around it, and dragging these points to smaller radius). \n",
