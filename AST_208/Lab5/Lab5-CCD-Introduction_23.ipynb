    "A bias frame is an image taken with zero exposure time---we just read out the CCD. A \"bias\" or \"zero\" level is a fixed number of counts given to every pixel on the CCD (this is often set by the manufacturer). CCDs can only detect positive numbers of counts, so the bias level allows us to measure fluctuations around the \"zero\" level, and ensure that these fluctuations are all safely in the positive, countable regime.\n",
    "\n",

When you are happy with your model bias, raise your hand to have an instructor come over and approve your image. They will check off your team on a sheet and you will get points for this question.\n",

The longer you leave the CCD running taking an image, the more dark current there will be in the image (it accumulates with time).
