According to this data set, we will have an approximate Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution that will increase in accuracy as the simulation goes on. Once we end the simulation, we will then proceed to estimate the Stefan–Boltzmann (SB) constant from the Monte Carlo's integrand of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve.
