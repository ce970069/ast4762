    "In the field of statistical physics, the behavior of ideal gases is fundamental for understanding the principles governing many physical systems. Ideal gases serve as a cornerstone in the development of statistical mechanics, providing a simple yet powerful model for studying the properties of gases at a microscopic level. By simulating ideal gases and analyzing their behavior, we can gain insights into macroscopic phenomena such as pressure, temperature, and energy distribution. Furthermore, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, which describes the speed distribution of particles in an ideal gas, is a pivotal concept in statistical physics, with broad implications in diverse fields such as astrophysics, chemistry, and engineering. The motivation for this project stems from the desire to validate the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and explore its connection to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant through computational methods, enhancing our understanding of these fundamental principles and their applications in various scientific disciplines.\n",

    "To model an Ideal Gas using the physics of elastic collisions, we first defined the physical properties of the gas particles, including mass and radius. We then implemented a Particle class in Python to represent the gas particles, incorporating methods for computing particle movement, collisions, and reflections. For the simulation setup, we defined parameters such as the number of particles, box size, and time parameters. We initialized a random distribution of particles within the box, ensuring no initial collisions. During the simulation execution, we iterated over time steps, during which particles moved, collided with each other, and reflected off the walls. We recorded particle positions, velocities, and kinetic energies at each time step for analysis. For data analysis, we computed the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution from the simulated particle velocities and compared it to the theoretical distribution to verify accuracy. Additionally, to verify the Stefan-Boltzmann constant using Monte Carlo methods, we calculated the total energy of the system based on the particle velocities and masses. We then used the Monte Carlo method to integrate the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to obtain the total energy and compared it to the known value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Finally, we evaluated the accuracy of the simulation by calculating the percentage error between the calculated Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the known value."

Our calculated value for the Stefan-Boltzmann constant was found to be $5.601*10^{-8} \\frac{W}{m^2*K^4}$, which has a percentage error of $1.22$% when compared to the actual value of the constant: $5.67*10^{-8} \\frac{W}{m^2*K^4}$ indicating that our simulation accurately reflects the physical properties of an ideal gas.\n",

    "An important observation is that our results should be accurate across different conditions, such as varying pressures and temperatures. While the computational time may differ for simulations under these conditions, the fundamental principles governing the behavior of the ideal gas remain consistent. This reinforces the reliability and versatility of our computational approach in analyzing complex physical systems. Future work could involve expanding the model to include variations in pressure, temperature, and other factors. Despite potential differences in computational time, the results should remain consistent, providing a robust framework for further exploration of ideal gas properties.\n",
