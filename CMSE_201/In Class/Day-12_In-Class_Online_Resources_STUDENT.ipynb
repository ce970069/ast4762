If I were presenting these plots, I would probably use the linear plot to note how much of the total exports are coming from just a small handful of countries--most of which are on Africa's west coast--and put special empahsis on the dominant role played by the Cote d'Ivoire. I would then use the log plot to talk about how there are still many countries that have *some* Cocoa bean exports, just significantly less than the top few countries. \n",
